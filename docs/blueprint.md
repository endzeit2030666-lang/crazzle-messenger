# **App Name**: CipherCom

## Core Features:

- E2E Encrypted Messaging: Send and receive text, media, and document messages with end-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol.
- Secure Key Exchange: Establish secure communication channels using a cryptographically sound key exchange protocol. The user can also optionally verify a QR code of the other party's public key, out of band, for improved security.
- Contact Verification: Verify contacts via public key fingerprints or QR code scanning.
- Local, Encrypted Search: Enable full-text search within encrypted messages using local indexing.
- Self-Destructing Messages: Optionally send self-destructing messages with a timer.
- Secure Data Deletion: Ensure data is securely deleted by overwriting it (where the OS allows).
- Context Aware Safety Tool: Leverage AI as a tool to warn users if they're about to share certain classes of sensitive info like passwords or account numbers, or if a communication exhibits indicators of fraud, phishing, or scam attempts. Reasoning is applied to determine when or whether to inject the appropriate notice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated violet (#673AB7) evoking a sense of trust, security, and sophistication.
